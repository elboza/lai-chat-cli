### MCP

partially implemented (only stdio transport layer for the moment).
MCP tools are disabled by default, but you can enable it at any time via command line flags (`-t` and `-k`), config file (`enable_mcp_tools` and `enable_mcp_tools_exec`) or cli commands (`/mcpt_switch` and `/mcpt_exec_switch`).

### RAG

you can add rag context manually via `/rag_vect_add` or add an entire text file via `/rag_import_file` . You can add rag context manually via `/rag_vect_add` or add an entire text file via `/rag_import_file`.

you can list the current rag memory db via the `/rag_vect_list`

you can submit your query to the model via the `/rag_lookup` command otherwise it will submit your query without the rag.

remember to check your rag model (`/info`) and you can change model via `/newragmodel` .

### examples

```
/* enable mcptools */
>>> /mcpt_switch

/* list mcp tools */
>>> /mcptools
demo__addition : addition of two numbers.
  - props: {"num1":{"description":"Number1","type":"STRING"},"num2":{"description":"Number2","type":"STRING"}}
  - required: ["num1","num2"]

/* enable mcp tools execution */
>>> /mcpt_exec_switch

/* direct mcp tool call */
>>> /mcpt_call demo__addition {num1: 2, num2:4}
 tool call ... demo addition { num1: 2, num2: 4 }

 sum of two numbers is 6

/* the model will call the tool if needed */
>>> 2+3
[ llm ]:
{"name":"demo__addition","args":{"num2":"3","num1":"2"}}
 tool call ... demo addition { num2: '3', num1: '2' }

 sum of two numbers is 5

/* manually add rags ... */
>>> /rag_vect_add my ferrari is red and goes very fast. more fast than the black lamborghini.
>>> /rag_vect_add the sun is light and yellow.
>>> /rag_vect_add the sea is blue.

/* list rag in-memory-DB */
>>> /rag_vect_list
1 : my ferrari is red and goes very fast. more fast than the black lamborghini. [ 3072 values ]
2 : the sun is light and yellow. [ 3072 values ]
3 : the sea is blue. [ 3072 values ]

/* query the llm model with rag context */
>>> /rag_lookup what color is my ferrari ??
[ llm ]:
Based on the context, your Ferrari is **red**.
